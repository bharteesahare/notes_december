Subject: Request for Work-from-Home During Ganpati Festival

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. With the upcoming Ganpati festival celebrations, I would like to discuss the possibility of working from home during the festive period. I believe that working remotely during this time will allow me to manage both my professional responsibilities and my commitment to the festival efficiently.

I understand the importance of maintaining our team's productivity and meeting project deadlines. Rest assured, I am committed to ensuring that my work remains unaffected despite the change in my work environment. I will be readily available during working hours, reachable through email, phone, and any other necessary communication channels. Additionally, I will provide regular updates on my progress and will make sure that all tasks are completed on time.

By working from home, I intend to contribute to a positive work-life balance and remain an active and engaged team member. This arrangement will also help me save commute time, allowing me to allocate more time and energy to my work tasks.

I kindly request your approval for this temporary work-from-home arrangement during the Ganpati festival, which is scheduled from [start date] to [end date]. If you have any concerns or adjustments to suggest, please feel free to share them. I assure you that my top priority remains delivering high-quality work and collaborating effectively with the team.

Thank you for considering my request. Your support in achieving a harmonious work arrangement is greatly appreciated. I look forward to your response and the opportunity to make this arrangement a success.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
